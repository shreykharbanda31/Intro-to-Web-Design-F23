      <br>
      <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at <a href = "https://engineering.nyu.edu/">New York University's School of Engineering - NYU Tandon</a>, 
      pursuing a BS of Computer Science along with two Minors in Web Programming and Applications and Mathematics. I am really passionate about NLP, Web Dev, Android, iOS, and Software Dev in particular. I direct NYU's premier hackathon club, <a href = "https://hacknyu.org/">HackNYU</a>, 
      actively research @ NYU's mLAB and develop @ IoT Inspector under Prof. Huang. I love baking, watching romantic comedies, visiting adventure parks, and am recently on a hunt for 
      finding the best Tiramisu in NYC.</p>
