                <div class="text"><p>From time constraints to evolving project requirements, software engineers are faced with several challenges in their day-to-day tasks. Production timelines are sometimes affected by factors that are beyond the engineersâ€™ control and are often required to adapt to any new changes enforced by their managers. At the same time, engineers have to keep upgrading the code base as the tech stack becomes outdated in comparison to new technologies populating in the market. Engineers also have to comply with security and data privacy regulations to keep their code base consistent and safe from potential vulnerabilities.</p></div>

                    <h2>Why do I love Software Engineering?</h2>
                    <p id = "opinion-body">I believe that Software Engineering allows me to exercise my creative and logical side in computer science. I have the ability to solve complex, real-world problems with simple and specific solutions. I would love to be at the forefront of innovation with Software Engineering. In this field, continuous learning is a key aspect to keep yourself updated with ongoing trends and collaboration with others enhances the experience and product strategy. I would love to make a positive impact on society and as a software engineer, I can become a part of a global community of professionals. I am interested in developing applications, interfaces, platforms, and communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to enliven the product and provide the best user experience. A good UX is important to increase customer retention and create a positive brand image. A user-friendly interface is important to ensure cost-effectiveness and provide an edge among other competitors in the market. With an entrepreneurial spirit, I am excited to contribute to the future of software engineering by innovating and solving complex issues to create new outlets and products.</p>
